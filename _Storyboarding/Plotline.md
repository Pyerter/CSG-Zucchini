# Plot


### Background

Our character is a technician who works for his/her mother and father in their company (people can call him/her the Technician, or Techy). His/her job was to repair broken mechanical body parts this this company would install on people.

After some time working at the company, the technician's mother and father, both died. Just before the father died, he had his mind uploaded to the first working copy of a device that would store one's memory.

The parents left the company to the Technician when they died, leaving the main character as the soul owner of this company.

### Chapter 1

Our character is on their way to pick up the finished copy of the father's mind. Upon reaching the facility, it is nowhere to be seen. Evidence of a break-in is present, and so the first objective of the player is to hunt down this thief.

During the time chasing this thief, our character's home was destroyed. Someone is after the Technician, and the player needs to find out who this is. This is the motive for our character's quest for revenge, or in another light, self-defense.

### Chapter N (Last)

Our character comes face to face with the villain. A conversation arises, where the villain explains why the mind-loading device needs to be destroyed. The Technician can either hear out the villain and plug in the device so the father can contribute to the conversation, or attack the villain right away.

Case 1: Father talks <br/>
The conversation reveals that the father is beginning to regret this invention, having gone insane from the time locked up with only his mind. He admits that his wife was right when she said that he would regret this. The villain reveals that the mother asked the villain to make sure that these chips are never released to the public. The father asks the Technician to follow this path. In this time, the father also creates a copy of the access files to retrieve the schematics to the mind-loaders. The player is now able to make a decision once more: destroy the mind-loaders or embrace them.

Both sub-cases:
Sub-case 1: Player disagrees <br/>
The villain lunges out and destroys the chip, launching the player into an all-out duel. With the player being the victor, he/she goes on to produce more chips and keep the company successful.

Sub-case 2: Player agrees <br/>
The villain assists the player in destroying the schematics, and destroying the mind-loader holding the Technician's father. The Technician goes on to dismantle the company and create housing in either the city or rural areas (depending on how much of their body was replaced by mechanical parts).

Case 2: The Player Is Aggressive <br/>
The villain strikes out and destroys the Father's mind-loader, launching the player and the villain into a duel. With the player being the victor, they're left with contuing the company's work in developing this mind-loading device.
