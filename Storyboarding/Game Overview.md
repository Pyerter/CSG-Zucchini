### Art Style

This game will be a 2D, side-view game with vector art. There will be great emphasis on particle effects and flashy movement. We will also try to make the game feel very smooth, in a way that it becomes entertaining just to move around.

The main character will be customizable in only color and different aesthetic additions gained from certain skills. We will not include direct character customization to avoid heavy work in this area.


### Gameplay

Once the player starts the game and learns about the main goal, they will have to rely on themselves to keep persuing this goal. We will not have several quest or bounty system so that the player has short term goals. Instead, the player will find story and rewards the accomplishing difficult tasks such as puzzles, boss-battles, or simply finding hidden locations.

The combat will mainly be hack-and-slash, but certain encounters will push the player to focus and use every tool in their arsenal. Due to the hack-and-slash nature, traversing the map may become as much of a challenge as killing low-tier enemies. Because of this, we will include several entertaining jumping puzzles and rewards for completing more complex ones.


### Customization

There will be a skill tree, where certain skills will alter the visual appearance of the player.

The skill tree will include a variety of abilities, ranging from small damage boosts to adding mechanics that offer alternative combat styles.
The branches of the skill tree will enhance unique playstyles, but each branch may have cross-overs with similar branches positioned adjacent one another. This will allow easier combinations of skills so that there can be larger variance in gameplay styles.

Skill points will not be based on level, but instead on simply acquiring skill points. There will be a system to allow the re-allocation of skill points so that the player doesn't have to start over in order to try out different builds.


### Story

The setting will be in a sci-fi universe. <br/>
The plot will be, in very general terms, the protagonist was wronged by the antogonist and seeks justice. Due to the corrupt world, our character is the only one with the ability to carry out this justice.

The protagonist had a child, who when they were very young, was taken away due to super-human traits that they developed. The justice our character seeks is the execution of the captors, the ones in charge, and the recovering of their child. To do this, our protagonist may have to cut down more than just a few opponents...
