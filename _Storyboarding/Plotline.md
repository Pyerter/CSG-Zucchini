# Plot


### Background

Our character is a technician who works for his/her mother and father in their company (people can call him/her the Technician, or Techy). His/her job was to repair broken mechanical body parts this this company would install on people.

After some time working at the company, the technician's mother died. His dad is growing old and nearing his deathbed.

### Chapter 1

We begin the story with our protagonist working on a machine in his garage, only to be interrupted by that group of strangers that Z's created bad ties with. Z has to kill the intruders as an intro to the game mechanics.

Z then goes to his job at his parent's company, mostly unphased by the event. The technician is then called to see his father, for the first time in over a year. His father talks to him about his future with the company, that one day Z will own it. This conversation reveals the tense relationship between the two, but also that the father trusts the son more than one would think.

At this point, Z is free to roam around the first zone. Once he sleeps in his home again, he wakes up to hear that his father died. Upon going to his office to mourn his loss, Z finds a letter out to Z. In it, a chip holding his father's mind. This introduces Z to stations that he can plug his father into to talk to him. His father reveals to Z that two men killed him that night. This sends Z on a mission to avenge his father.

### Chapter 2

Z finds a high official in that group and kills them. During his search for this person, he probably crafted a new weapon or two and grew slightly closer to his dad.

### Chapter 3

Z finds another official and interrogates him, leading him on a trail to kill the leader of the group.

### Chapter 4

Something.

### Chapter 5

Z finds the official, who before he dies, reveals that he was requisitioned to send men after Z's father.

### Chapter 6

Z is confronted by the remaining officials of the group, who pose an unstoppable threat and kill Z.

### Chapter 7

Z is brought back to life by a stranger, who seems familiar and unusually peculiar. Z then explores and attempts to reconcile with his death.

### Chapter 8

Z hunts down and kills that group of officials who initially killed him.


### Chapter 9

Z picks up a trail to find this villain.

### Chapter 10 (Last)

Our character comes face to face with the villain. A conversation arises, where the villain explains why the mind-loading device needs to be destroyed. The Technician can either hear out the villain and plug in the device so the father can contribute to the conversation, or attack the villain right away.

Case 1: Father talks <br/>
The conversation reveals that the father is beginning to regret this invention, having gone insane from the time locked up with only his mind. He admits that his wife was right when she said that he would regret this. The villain reveals that the mother asked the villain to make sure that these chips are never released to the public. The father asks the Technician to follow this path. In this time, the father also creates a copy of the access files to retrieve the schematics to the mind-loaders. The player is now able to make a decision once more: destroy the mind-loaders or embrace them.

Both sub-cases:
Sub-case 1: Player disagrees <br/>
The villain lunges out and destroys the chip, launching the player into an all-out duel. With the player being the victor, he/she goes on to produce more chips and keep the company successful.

Sub-case 2: Player agrees <br/>
The villain assists the player in destroying the schematics, and destroying the mind-loader holding the Technician's father. The Technician goes on to dismantle the company and create housing in either the city or rural areas (depending on how much of their body was replaced by mechanical parts).

Case 2: The Player Is Aggressive <br/>
The villain strikes out and destroys the Father's mind-loader, launching the player and the villain into a duel. With the player being the victor, they're left with contuing the company's work in developing this mind-loading device.
