# CSG-Zucchini
This is a small game that Porter Squires, Michael Zabrowski, Alex Zabrowski, and Nicholas Pautsch are going to be working on over a Summer.


### Work Flow

Our Master Branch will act as the release branch and the structure will follow like so:

Master

   |          |    \__ Feature
   |          |           |   \__ Feature Patch
   |          |           |             |
   |          |           |             |
   |          |           |             |
Master    Developer    Feature    Feature Patch
