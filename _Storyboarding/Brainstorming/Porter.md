### Genre
Sci-fi with high priority on mechanical gadgets rather than laser.


### Skill Tree
Innate skills:
1. Light Attack (generate energy)
1. Heavy Attack (consume energy)

The skill tree will have several sections that are locked by significant abilities, such as dash or double jump, that are unlocked with game progression.

Within each section, all nodes will be available by following various node paths.

Sections:
1. Primary Section (standard movement/combat/resource upgrades, biggest section)
1. Boost Pack (increased jump height and dash to side)
1. Mini-nuke (handheld grenade that annihalates everything on screen)

I want it to be possible to do nuke-only runs.


### Weapons
Our character is going to be primarily melee with a few ranged options. <br/>
Each weapon will have different versions more powerful than the other, in order from least to most: base, mechanical, and laser. <br/>
Note: while walking around, the player holds a handheld device that accepts a chip that synthesizing the corresponding weapon on attack. <br/>
Weapon Categories:
1. Scythe
1. Gauntlet
1. Sword
1. Greatsword

Enemies will be primarily ranged, but some will have melee capabilities. Touching an enemy will also cause damage.


### Player Resources
Our player's healthpool will consist of Vitality and Durability. Vitality is the human health portion of our character, while Durability is the mechanical health portion. The advantage of Vitality is manual healing, you heal in chunks through your own actions. The advantage of Durability is continuous healing, nanobots will heal you slowly over time.

Our abilities with limited use will be reliant on a resource pool that is filled due to the actions of the player, attacking enemies or meditating or whatnot.<br/>
This resource will be stored in batteries. These batteries will be tapped into via adapters. Example, Vitality Adapter would heal the player by consuming energy. <br/>
Aesthetically, these batteries will be visible and their energy levels will also be visible on the player. Of course, we will have a HUD element with this information also available. 


### Currency
Quarks - aka Qs "How many Qs you got?", "That'll be about 500 Qs"
